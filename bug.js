This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing a keyExtractor function that does not return a unique key for each item in the data array.  This leads to inconsistent rendering and performance issues.  The error message itself might not be explicit about the keyExtractor problem, leading to confusion.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, the `id` field is not unique, causing the error.  Sometimes the error manifests as seemingly random component behavior, or silent failure to update items properly.
